# Week #8 Lesson Plan
VERIFY LEARNING OBJECTIVES ARE DEEP ENOUGH


- There will be a quiz on Wednesday covering material up to and including the previous week.
- Part 6 is also due Wednesday at midnight.

## Overview
- This week we will cover Python's built-in logging library and autodocs (using `mkdocs`).
- We will also cover a number of issues that are arising in the project code.

## Resources
- [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) has solid documentation and a good quick start guide.
- [The Python logging docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) contain a solid tutorial.

## Learning objectives

- What are some reasons to use log files?
- Identify the key components and purposes of logging systems, including debugging, system state monitoring, security compliance, performance measurement, and business intelligence.
- Structure log entries properly with essential elements: timestamp, event description, source information, contextual data, and severity level. Be able to define each.
- Apply Python's built-in logging library to implement custom logging solutions with appropriate formatting and handlers.
- Configure logging severity levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) based on different operational environments and needs.
- Implement structured logging practices to ensure consistency in timestamp formats, data organization, and communication patterns across log events.
