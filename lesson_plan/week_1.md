# Week #1 Lesson Plan

## Overview
* There is no _quiz_ during week \#1.
* However, on Wednesday you will need to verify that your computer is set up according to [the preliminary assignment](../assignments/prelims.md). This will be graded as a quiz (out of 5 points).
* Monday and Wednesday will both be lectures.

## Resources
* Chapter \#1 of [Effective Computation in Physics](http://lilith.fisica.ufmg.br/~dickman/transfers/comp/textos/Effective%20Computation%20in%20Physics%20(Python).pdf) covers a lot of the ground here. 
* You can also ask an LLM (ChatGPT, etc.) tons of questions and get good results. The information in this chapter is old, well-known and you can expect to get the correct results using any well-trained LLM.

## Learning objectives

* Describe why we use the shell and terminal rather than GUI-based systems.
* Definitions:
  * Prompt
  * Shell
  * File System
  * File Extension
  * Arguments vs. options/flags/switches 
* Navigating the file system
  * `pwd`, `ls` and `cd`
  * Wildcards (`*`)
  * Relative vs. absolute paths
  * Special locations (`.`, `..` and `~`)
* File manipulations:
  * `mkdir`, `rmdir`
  * `touch`
  * `mv`, `cp`
* Basic shell commands:
  * `echo`
  * Setting and referencing variables in the shell
  * Listing variables (`env` and `set`)
* Dealing with data in the terminal and files:
  * Preview/interact with files using `more`, `less`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`
  * Saving and appending to a file with `>` and `>>`
  * Redirecting terminal output with `|`
  * Searching lines using `grep` 
  * Counting with `wc`
* Using `which` to identify what program is being run
* The `PATH` environment variable

## Quizzable concepts

* Create and remove directories
* Copy, move and remove files (with and without wildcards)
* Use `touch` to create an empty file.
* Move to specific locations in the file system using absolute, relative or special location paths.
* Be able to define the concepts mentioned in the definitions above.
- Given a file, count the number of lines in which a pattern occurs (or does not occur); keep in mind case sensitivity.
- Redirect terminal output using any of `|`, `>`, and `>>`.
- Use `cat`, `head`, and `tail` to cut up pieces of a file.
- Use any of our commands to create output and then use `grep` and `wc` to filter and count words.
- Set an environment variable at both the `session` and `environment` level.
- Explain the difference between `set` and `env`.
- Explain what the environment variable `PATH` does.

- Some more complex examples with answers:
  - Use `ls` and `grep` to find all files in a directory which have `frank` in their name, but do not have `stein` in their name.
    - Answer: `ls | grep frank | grep -v stein`
  - Use `ls` and `grep` to find all PDF files in a directory which have `frank` in their name, but do not have `stein` in their name.
    - Answer: `ls *.pdf | grep frank | grep -v stein`
- The file `students.txt` contains a list of CNET IDs (one per line).
  - Count the number of times that `nickross` appears anywhere on a line.
  - Count the number of times `nick` appears on a line, but `ross` does not.
