# Final Week Information

There are two components of finals week:
1. Delivering on the final part of the project. Information on this assignment can be found in [Part VIII](../project_assignments/part_8.md)
2. An in-person final exam. 

## In-person final exam information

- The exam will be 60 minutes long. It will start promptly at the scheduled time and end 60 minutes thereafter. If you show up late you will not be given additional time at the end.
- The exam will mirror the quiz format and content. 
- As with the quiz, the final exam will be closed note, with no computer, and will only require you to show up with a writing implement.
- The tentative plan for the final is to include examples (sections of) a `Dockerfile`, a `Makefile`, some `Python` code, and a file system. You will be asked to write code and answer questions about the code.
- The exam will also consist of a number of traditional knowledge questions that do not require writing code directly.
- The exam is comprehensive and covers material from the entire class.
- How to study:
  - Leverage the quizzes!
  - Review the material in the weekly lesson plans, especially the quizzable materials.
  - Review the material in the [prerequisites doc](../docs/prerequisites.md) to make sure you feel comfortable with all the concepts!
