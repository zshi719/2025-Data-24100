## Grading Questions & Late Policy

The following document contains information about the grading policy for this course. Please read _the entire_ document before submitting.

Please direct all questions about grading and regrading via email to the professor and _not_ the teaching assistants. Some general guidelines:

- The most common problem with grading is that the math is wrong (e.g. `5 + 5 = 8`). In this case please just take a photo of the math in question and send it via email.

- Partial credit is (generally) not up for regrade. If an answer is incomplete or incorrect, or if a project assignment does meet the standards of the rubric the amount of partial credit given is set during the grading and applied evenly across all students. 

- In any event, all grading questions should be sent by email.

- If you are asking for clarity on a project grade, _make sure to include all members of your group on the email_. If I receive an email asking for grading clarity from a single team member without the rest of the team I will not respond to the request until all team members are on the email.

- Any assignment submitted more than 2 hours late will automatically receive 50\% off.
