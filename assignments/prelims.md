## Preliminaries

This document contains a list of software and set up that needs to be completed by the end of the first week.

Please follow the instructions [here](https://clinic.ds.uchicago.edu/tutorials/clinic-computer-setup.html) for only the software that needs to be installed. You need to install:

1. Unix Command Line Terminal
2. Visual Studio Code
3. Terminal Based Git
4. Docker
5. Make
6. SSH / No-AI Cluster

Note that you do **NOT** need to deal with the cluster, but you need to be able to use git at the terminal.
