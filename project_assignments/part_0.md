# Project Part #0

This document describes the preliminary work that needs to be completed by the end of week \#1 of the course. 

### Join a group on Canvas

Please organize yourselves into a Canvas group of 2â€“4 members. I recommend 3 or 4; groups larger than four are not allowed. Use the Canvas Group Set called "Project Group" to organize yourselves. Groups are numbered; you and your teammates should join the same group.

These groups will remain in place for the entire quarter. 

### Fill out the Canvas assignment

As a group, you will need to fill out the Canvas assignment so that we can create a GitHub repository for you and your team members. 

Make sure that you _carefully_ record information about your group in the assignment. Spelling errors and incomplete or incorrect information will lead to lower grades.

### Join your GitHub group

After the assignment is reviewed, you will receive an invite to the GitHub repository for your team. Accept the invitation to gain access to the repository.

_Graders_: Refer to the admin docs about how to set up the github repo.
