This was WAY too short and easy.

\noindent \textbf{Instructions:} \begin{itemize}
\item When writing python code be careful about spacing / indents. Leave enough room that it is obvious when you want things indented. 
\item You should pull off the first page of the exam to use as reference.
\item Make sure to write legibly.
\item Please write your name on the top of the next page.
\item You will have one hour to complete the exam.
\item You are allowed to use commands not covered in class, but if they do not work as expected on my computer they will not receive full credit.
\end{itemize}

Additional notes or comments: 

\clearpage

\begin{enumerate}

\item (5 Points) Your current working directory is \texttt{/data/pdf} directory, using a \emph{relative} path and a single command (do not change directories) please move all the PDF files in \texttt{/data/docs} to your current directory (\texttt{/data/pdf}).

\vspace{5cm}

\item Using \texttt{bash} commands please complete the following. You are currently in the \texttt{/logs} directory. The files contain logs generated by our custom logger, similar to what we demonstrated in class. Each file contains logs from the date specified in the file name. You can see an example of the format of the logs in the sample.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item (5 Points) Create a file (\texttt{error\_logs.log}) which contains all lines that have \texttt{ERROR} written in them (this should be \emph{case sensitive}) from the file \texttt{2024.12.11\_flask.log}. E.g. we want a file which contains only those lines. 
\vspace{5cm}
	\item (5 Points) Print to the screen the \emph{number} of times \texttt{ERROR131} occurs in the log file \texttt{2024.12.11\_flask.log}.
\vspace{5cm}

\end{enumerate}

\item (8 Points) When we run \texttt{make interactive} what is the full path, \emph{inside the container}, for the file \texttt{result.pdf}?

\vspace{2cm}

\item (5 Points) When we talk about testing, what does \emph{coverage} mean? (1-2 sentences max)

\vspace{5cm}

\newpage

\item Looking at our flask server code above, please write what is returned when the following calls are made. Please provide both the body and the status code.


\begin{enumerate}
\item (3 Points) A GET request to \texttt{/exam/1/bob}
\vspace{4cm}
\item (3 Points) A GET request to \texttt{/exam/1/dylan}
\vspace{4cm}
\end{enumerate}



\item (2 Points) What does DRY stand for when speaking about code quality?


\vspace{3cm}

\item (10 Points) The code for \texttt{/exam/2} needs to be completed. The code should return:
\begin{itemize}
	\item If the employee exists it should return a JSON object of the form: \\ \texttt{\{"name": NAME OF PERSON, "age": AGE of PERSON\}} with a status code of 200.
	\item If the employee does not exist it should return an error message in JSON format (you can decide what it says) with a status code of 404.
\end{itemize}


\vspace{5cm} 


\newpage
\item (8 Points) Fill in the table below showing what CRUD operations stand for and their corresponding HTTP methods. 


\begin{center}
	

\begin{tabular}{|c|p{8cm}|p{6cm}|}
\hline 
Letter & \centering What it stands for & HTTP Method Used \\
\hline
C & & \\[.75cm]
\hline
R & & \\[.75cm]
\hline
U & & \\[.75cm]
\hline
D & & \\[.75cm]
\hline
\end{tabular}

\end{center}



\item (5 Points) Please write a unit test for the following function. This function only needs to have one test condition. Please name the function \texttt{test\_math\_func}.


\begin{verbatim}
def math_func(a, b, c):
    return (a * b) + c
\end{verbatim}


\vspace{5cm}

\item (5 Points) In the Dockerfile shown above there is a line between the pip run  and the final \texttt{CMD}. In that space, please write the command to set an environment variable (\texttt{API\_KEY}) equal to \texttt{111222}.


\vspace{2cm}

\item (5 Points)  Please write a function \texttt{g} which takes in three arguments: \texttt{odd\_func}, \texttt{even\_func} and \texttt{x}. \texttt{x} is an integer while \texttt{odd\_func} and \texttt{even\_func} are functions. If \texttt{x} is even it should return \texttt{even\_func} with \texttt{x} provided as the first argument and if \texttt{x} is odd it should return \texttt{odd\_func} with \texttt{x} provided as the first argument.


\end{enumerate}
